This is a minimalistic, responsive homepage.  

One option is to use basic HTML and CSS to build your homepage.  That is as
lightweight as it gets.

I expect that most visitors will be using a small phone screen.  Thus, your
homepage should also be responsive.  A responsive website resizes and
reorganizes itself to different screen sizes.  The easiest way I have found to
make your site responsive is to use Bootstrap.  First, the navigation bar
automatically collapses.  Second, the grid system automatically reorganizes as
the screen shrinks. 

## Requirements 

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
